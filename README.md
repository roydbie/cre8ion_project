# cre8ion fussball organizer

At the office of the Cre8ion.Lab the workload can be heavy sometimes. Breaks are very important to the employees as this is a way to distract themselves. During these breaks lots of employees will play a game of Fussball table of FIFA. How are we able to track the best player in the office? Is there a way to trigger everybody to participate. Can we make sure even the bad players will participate?
